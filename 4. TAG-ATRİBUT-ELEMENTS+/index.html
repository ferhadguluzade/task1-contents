    <li><p>Tag</p>
        <p class="content">In information systems, a tag is a keyword or term assigned to a piece of information (suchas an Internet bookmark,
        digital
        image, database record, or computer file). This kind of metadata helps describe an item and allows it to be found again
        by
        browsing or searching <sup>[1]</sup>. Tags are generally chosen informally and personally by the item's creator or by its viewer,
        depending on the system, although they may also be chosen from a controlled vocabulary.<sup>[2]</sup></p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Attribute</p>
        <p class="content">
        
            HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag to control the element's behaviour. HTML attributes are a
            modifier of an HTML element type. An attribute either modifies the default functionality of an element type or provides
            functionality to certain element types unable to function correctly without them. In HTML syntax, an attribute is added
            to an HTML starttag.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Element</p>
        <p class="content">An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) document or web page.[vague]
        HTML is composed of a tree of HTML nodes, such as text nodes. Each node can have HTML attributes specified. Nodes can
        also have content, including other nodes and text. Many HTML nodes represent semantics or meaning. For example, the
        &lt;title&gt; node represents the title of the document.</p>

        [1] Some users, however, see     tags not as metadata but as "just more content": Berendt, Bettina; Hanser, Christoph
        (2007). "Tags are not metadata, but 'just more content'-to
        some people" (PDF). Proceedings of the International Conference on Weblogs and Social Media (ICWSM), Boulder, Colorado,
